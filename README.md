# needle

Needle is a deep learning system built from scratch when I taking CMU 10-414/714 courses. Taking this oppotunity, I would like to implement more features beyond the course for fun. 

Needle stands for **ne**cessary **e**lements of **d**eep **l**earning. You can also viewed it as a sewing needle that threads through clothes to form (neural)net patterns, and the create traces for automatic differentiation.
